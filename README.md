This is a simple website made for the band Maple &amp; Rye. It started as the major degree project of student Henrik Bielsten at Yrgo, Gothenburg. The focus was to learn more about [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) and using [Wordpress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) as a headless API. Currently it is a work in progress.
